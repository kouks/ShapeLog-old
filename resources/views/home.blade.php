Additionally, it is completely up to you what data you want to log by creating your own custom tags. You can also look up your friends and see how they do, as well as compare their progress.</p>

            <p class="justify big serif">Our app is a great motivational tool, too! Since it is not pleasant to watch your stats decrease, we believe that it would be great factor contributing to your motivation. If that is not enough though, here is another fact - even your friends can check your graphs, and imagine them mocking at you as your progress goes down. Keep up the great work!</p>
